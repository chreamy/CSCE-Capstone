Manual / Regression Test Instructions
====================================

These scripts exercise the lengthy optimization scenarios we added for the
Instrumentation Amplifier netlists. They rely on the same Python environment
used for the main app (numpy, scipy, etc.).

From the project root (`csce483CapstoneFall2025-main`), activate the virtual
environment and run:

1. Long transient stress test
   ```
   python -m backend.manual_tests.long_instr_amp_test
   ```
   - Drives a 5k-point transient target through the optimizer with widened
     bounds and tight tolerances.
   - Expect a long runtime; use it sparingly as a regression/stability check.

2. Long AC stress test
   ```
   python -m backend.manual_tests.long_instr_amp_ac_test
   ```
   - Mirrors the transient test but targets the AC magnitude response and
     produces thousands of frequency samples.
   - Also runs for an extended period and is intended to catch performance
     regressions.

Both scripts log their detailed progress under the `runs/` directory (just like
the UI-driven workflows), so you can compare `session.log` and generated PRN
files after they finish.
