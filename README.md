# XycLOps II: Automated Circuit Optimization Platform

**Version:** 2.0 (Fall 2025)  
**Backend Engine:** Xyce (Sandia National Labs)  
**Framework:** Python 3.10+ / Tkinter / SciPy

---

## 📖 Overview

XycLOps (**Xyc**e **L**oop **Op**timizer **s**ystem) is a desktop application that automates the tuning of analog circuit parameters. By interfacing with the **Xyce** parallel electronic simulator, it iteratively adjusts component values (resistors, capacitors, inductors) until the circuit's output matches a user-defined target curve.

**XycLOps II** represents a complete architectural overhaul, introducing support for **Multi-Physics Optimization** (Transient, AC, and Noise), interactive **Visual Target Editors**, and a modern, responsive user interface.

---

## ✨ Key Features in v2.0

* **Multi-Physics Support:** Optimize circuits for Time-Domain (Transient), Frequency Response (AC), and Noise Spectral Density.
* **Visual Target Editors:** Draw step responses and piecewise-linear curves interactively instead of manually creating CSV files. Includes a one-click "Apply to Target" workflow.
* **Modern UI:** A centralized theming engine provides a clean, professional interface with real-time plotting.
* **Workspace-Aware Logging:** Automated session management organizes logs and results into versioned folders (`netlist-results/<netlist>/<session>`).
* **Robust Parsing:** Enhanced support for LTSpice-style `.PARAM` definitions, complex netlist hierarchies, and UTF-8-SIG encoding.
* **Safe Execution:** Dedicated background threading for the solver ensures the UI never freezes, with a robust "Abort" capability.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

1.  **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux.
2.  **Python:** Version **3.10** or higher.
3.  **Simulator:** Xyce must be installed and added to your system's `PATH`.
    * Verification: Open a terminal and type `Xyce -v`.

## 📦 Installation

It is recommended to run XycLOps II in a virtual environment to manage dependencies (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pillow`, etc.).

### 1. Setup Virtual Environment

**Windows:**

    # Create the environment
    python -m venv xyclopsvenv

    # Activate it
    .\xyclopsvenv\Scripts\activate

**macOS / Linux:**

    # Create the environment
    python3 -m venv xyclopsvenv

    # Activate it
    source xyclopsvenv/bin/activate

### 2. Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

-----

## 🚀 Running the Application

To launch the XycLOps II user interface:

    # Ensure your virtual environment is active!
    python main_app.py

> **Note for Windows Users:** The application includes `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` handling, making it safe to package with PyInstaller if needed.

## 📖 User Workflows

### 1. Upload Netlist

  * Click **"Upload Netlist"** and select a valid SPICE file (`.cir`, `.net`, `.txt`).
  * The system parses components and automatically clears previous session state.

### 2. Parameter Selection

  * The tool lists available components.
  * Select the components (e.g., `R1`, `C3`) you want the optimizer to tune.

### 3. Optimization Settings

Choose your analysis type and configure targets:

#### 📈 Transient Analysis

  * Settings: Configure `Stop Time`, `Time Step`, `Start Time`, and `Max Step`.
  * UIC: Toggle "Use Initial Conditions" to bypass DC operating point calculation.
  * Target: Use the **Heaviside Editor** to visually draw a step response target (e.g., 0V to 5V rise).

#### 🔊 AC Analysis

  * Settings: Select **Sweep Type** (DEC/LIN/OCT) and frequency range (Start/Stop Hz).
  * Target: Upload a CSV defining the target Bode plot (Gain vs. Frequency).
  * Response: Optimize for Magnitude (dB), Phase, or Real/Imaginary parts.

#### 📉 Noise Analysis

  * Settings: Select **Output Node** (e.g., `V(out)`) and **Input Source**.
  * Target: Define a target noise floor (e.g., 10 nV/√Hz).
  * Quantity: Optimize for **Output Noise** (`onoise`) or **Input Referred Noise** (`inoise`).

### 4. Run & Monitor

  * Click **"Begin Optimization"**.
  * The **Dashboard** shows a real-time plot of the simulation vs. your target.
  * A **Sidebar** streams logs from the backend.
  * A floating **Convergence Window** displays real-time improvement percentage.

## 🔧 Developer Tools & Testing

XycLOps II includes utilities for profiling and regression testing.

### Startup Profiler

Measure import overhead and diagnose slow launches:

    python analyze_startup_time.py

### Stress Test Harnesses

Headless scripts located in `backend/manual_tests/` verify solver behavior without the UI.

  * **Transient Stress Test:**

        python -m backend.manual_tests.long_instr_amp_test

    *Optimizes a 7-variable Instrumentation Amplifier with strict tolerances (1e-14).*

  * **AC Stress Test:**

        python -m backend.manual_tests.long_instr_amp_ac_test

    *Performs frequency domain optimization from 10 Hz to 1 MHz.*

-----

## 📂 Project Structure

  * `main_app.py`: Application entry point.
  * `frontend/`: UI code (Tkinter), including `ui_theme.py` and `visual_curve_editors.py`.
  * `backend/`: Core logic. `curvefit_optimization.py` (solver) and `netlist_parse.py` (SPICE parser).
  * `runs/`: Automatically generated session logs and result artifacts.

-----

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

  * **"Xyce not found"**: Ensure the path to the Xyce executable is in system environment variables.
  * **Flatlined Graphs**: Try enabling **"Default Bounds"** in settings to widen the search space.
  * **Slow Startup**: Run the startup profiler script to identify which library causes delays.
